Additionally, minimal patchy atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region was noted, slightly more pronounced than before. On the other hand, in the current image, a left-sided pigtail catheter was seen without any pneumothorax. There was a minimal and unchanged left apical pneumothorax, along with a small left effusion.

The absence of pneumothorax and normal mediastinal and cardiac contours further support the stability of the patient's condition.

Atelectasis refers to the collapse or closure of a lung or a portion of it, which can be caused by mucus plugging or obstruction. In the context of the patient's history of pneumonia, the persistent consolidation within the lingula and left upper lobe along with the increased atelectasis suggests that the pneumonia is still present and possibly worsening. Further evaluation, such as CT scanning, is recommended to assess the integrity of the airway and determine the appropriate course of treatment."

Although they are still visible, they predominantly occur in the perihilar areas. Additionally, there is a moderate pleural effusion that has not substantially changed.

The patient experienced worsening moderate pulmonary edema, with bilateral layering effusions, with the left lung being more affected than the right.

There is also worsening airspace consolidation in the right upper, right middle, and lower lobes, as well as within the left upper and lower lobes, indicating worsening pneumonia. The airspace consolidation now limits the evaluation of cardiac and mediastinal contours. Furthermore, the stomach appears to be distended with gas and there is likely a layering left effusion."

In terms of edema, there was previous mild pulmonary edema which has now improved to a moderate level. The recommendation is to consider partial withdrawal of the right basal pleural tube which crosses the midline in the lower hemi thorax. Based on the current visit, mild edema and atelectasis persist at both lung bases, and the heart size is still mildly enlarged. Any remaining pleural effusions are small, if present.

There is also a moderate right pleural effusion that has increased, along with mild perihilar edema in the left lung. Additionally, there are several medical tubes and drains in place. In the second image, the patient has been extubated and lung volumes are lower. The Swan-Ganz catheter and upper enteric drainage tube have been removed, while two midline and one left pleural drains are still in place. The mild pulmonary edema has improved, and the small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is smaller. The post-operative widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly larger but unchanged.

The right-sided internal jugular vein central venous pressure (IJV CVP) line was also present with the tip at the cavoatrial junction. The heart size remained unchanged. However, the known right infrahilar mass was suboptimally visualized on the previous chest radiograph, and the postobstructive consolidation of the right lower lobe remained unchanged. Additionally, there was left lower lobe airspace opacification with an associated effusion, which appeared similar compared to the previous two days but appeared worse than on the radiographs before that. Emphysematous changes were observed in the upper lobes, and a feeding tube was in situ with the tip projecting over the fundus of the stomach. The impression from the previous visit is unknown, while the impression from the current visit is that the moderately severe pulmonary edema has worsened, accompanied by moderate right and small left pleural effusions, which may not be larger today. Cardiomegaly is only mild, and no pneumothorax is observed. ET tube, nasogastric drainage tube, and right jugular line are in standard placements."

Pulmonary vascular congestion is moderate and has worsened in both lungs. The heart borders are not well seen due to effusion, but it is probably unchanged in size.

In this case, the pleural effusion has developed since the prior study, suggesting a new occurrence. The size of the pleural effusion and associated findings, such as left basilar atelectasis and patchy right basilar opacity, indicate a potential hemothorax as a differential consideration. Hemothorax refers to the presence of blood in the pleural space, which can occur due to trauma or other underlying conditions. Further evaluation, such as dedicated left rib films, may be beneficial to assess the contour abnormality of the left sixth rib and determine if acute injury is involved. Overall, the newly observed left-sided pleural effusion is a significant finding and requires further investigation to identify its cause and guide appropriate management."

However, the possibility of recurrent malignancy is also considered due to the persistent enlargement and increased density of the right hilum. The management recommendation for this finding is to treat for pneumonia with short-term follow-up radiographs. Since there is also potential concern for aortic dissection, an immediate chest CTA is recommended as a CXR alone is not sufficient for detecting or excluding this diagnosis."
